    "# Advanced Data Standardization\n",
    "One of the challenges in analyzing police data is that different agencies will use different column names for the same data and will use different codes and terms for the data in the columns. Particularly, if you are looking at multiple datasets, it is valuable for the data to be standardized so that you know in advance what some key columns will be called and what values will be in those columns. To provide the user with more consistent column names and data, OpenPoliceData provides powerful tools to automatically standardize column names and data in order. \n",
